# Hello-World
Just started with ESP32

28.07.2017 After hours spend on my PC trying to have the Hello world running with ESP 32 I deside to change course and start with GIT.
The main problem I face wast with the Free RTOS. It seems that GCC Xtensa is not fully compatible and the Hello world example will not run with it. It seam that some #define fonction are producing problem. I will use this project in the hope to fix it. MOZ
